I recently created a weather app for my 1st internship project at codtech. my goal was to design a to provide users with 
an easy-to-use tool to track time spent on various tasks or websites, enhancing productivity and helping with time management.

Highlights:
Modern Design:
A clean interface that features an intuitive timer display, clear task management, and a color-coded dashboard to show different activities.
Real-Time Time Tracking:
The extension tracks the amount of time spent on websites or tasks with a start/stop button that users can interact with.
It includes the ability to log specific activities by category (work, personal, breaks) for better organization.
Tracking & Reporting:
Users can generate time reports that provide insights into their daily or weekly productivity patterns, helping them understand how their time is spent.
